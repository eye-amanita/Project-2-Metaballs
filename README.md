# Project 2 - Modular Metaballs

*Adapted from [Dan Schiffman/thecodingtrain's Metaball Script (p5.js Version by Basile Petin)](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/ISPozOLXW)*

My main goal while working on this project was to combine and contrast the organic form factor and unpredictable behavior of the existing metaballs algorithm/script with a more rigid, modular, and stylized approach to the overall composition and visual aesthetic. There are several randomized factors that lend uniqueness and unpredictability to each generated composition, however there is also relatively tight control and rules over how everything is displayed. Color-wise I was inspired by Mid-century Modern tiles and color palettes, as well as the architectural works of Mexican modernists such as Luis Barrag√°n.
